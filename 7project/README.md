## Project Deliverables

Your project submission consists of five main deliverables:

### 1. Design Document (design.md)

Deadline: **September 19, 2025**

You are required to prepare a design document for your application.
The design doc should be brief, well-organized and easy to understand.
The design doc should be prepared in markdown format and named `design.md` and submitted in the project group's repository.
Remember that you can use [mermaid diagrams](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) in markdown files.

The design doc **should include** the following sections:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the application and its purpose.
- **Architecture**: The high-level architecture of the application, including components, interactions, and data flow.
- **Technologies**: The cloud computing technologies or services used in the application.
- **Deployment**: The deployment strategy for the application, including any infrastructure requirements.

The design document should be updated throughout the development process and reflect the final implementation of your project.

Optional sections may include:

- Security: The security measures implemented in the application to protect data and resources.
- Scalability: The scalability considerations for the application, including load balancing and auto-scaling.
- Monitoring: The monitoring and logging strategy for the application to track performance and detect issues.
- Disaster Recovery: The disaster recovery plan for the application to ensure business continuity in case of failures.
- Cost Analysis: The cost analysis of running the application on the cloud, including pricing models and cost-saving strategies.
- References: Any external sources or references used in the design document.

### 2. Codebase

The codebase is the main deliverable for this project.
The project code should be well-organized, documented, and easily reproducible.
All source code and configuration files required to build and run the application must be included in your repository.

### 3. Reproducibility Report (report.md)

The `report.md` file serves as the primary documentation for your project and is critical for reproducibility.
It should include:

- **Project Overview**: Brief description of what the application does and its purpose.
- **Architecture Overview**: High-level description of the system architecture.
- **Prerequisites**: List of required software, tools, and dependencies.
- **Build Instructions**: Step-by-step commands to build the project from source.
- **Deployment Instructions**: Clear, reproducible steps to deploy the application.
- **Testing Instructions**: How to run tests (unit, integration, end-to-end).
- **Usage Examples**: How to use the application once deployed.
- **Presentation Video**: Link to your 10-minute presentation video.
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions.
- **Hour Sheet**: Time tracking for each group member showing hours spent on different activities.
- **Self-Assessment Table**: A detailed breakdown of tasks completed by each group member.

**Focus on Reproducibility**:
The deployment should be as simple as possible.
Anyone should be able to follow your instructions and successfully deploy your application.
Include all necessary configuration files, environment variables, and setup scripts.

**Assessment and Accountability**:
The report must include honest self-assessment and time tracking.
Each group member should accurately report their contributions and time spent on the project.
Each contribution should be linked to the specific commit on GitHub.
This information will be used for individual grading and to ensure fair contribution across team members.

**Report Template**:
Use the provided `report.md` template to structure your report.
This template includes all required sections and provides guidance on what information to include.
Simply overwrite the template content with your project-specific information.

**Use AI Tools**:
We strongly encourage teams to use AI tools to assist with code generation, documentation, and testing.
While we do encourage this, the team is ultimately responsible for ensuring the quality and accuracy of the final deliverables.
We recommend adding an `AGENTS.md` file to your repository to guide the AI to your project-specific requirements.

Please read what you can add to your `AGENTS.md` file over at [agents.md](https://agents.md).
Most AI tools should recognize the `AGENTS.md` file and use it to tailor their responses to your project's context.
(The `AGENTS.md` file replaces similar files like `copilot-instructions.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and similar.)

### 4. Presentation Video

You are required to prepare a presentation video of your project.
The presentation video should be uploaded to YouTube and the link should be included in your `report.md` file.

  - Ensure all text and code shown in the video is readable
  - Use diagrams and visuals to explain concepts clearly
  - Keep visual consistency (font size, color scheme) throughout the video
  - Limit slides to key points; avoid dense text

- **Audio & Narration**

  - Speak at a steady pace, clearly articulating key points
  - Use simple language and avoid overloading with technical jargon
  - Consider using AI tools for audio enhancement or voice generation if needed
  - Ensure good audio quality - use a decent microphone

### 5. Q&A Session

- Criteria review against the checklist
- Each team member presents their work and receives feedback
- (More details about the format may be added later)

## Project Selection Guidelines

Your next step is to choose a project you want to pursue and describe its design in the design document, as [outlined above](#1-design-document-designmd).

Below are some specific ideas for projects that you can choose from.

> Several of these projects were generated by Copilot with only minor adjustments.
> Hence, do not take everything at face value, including the implementation and technology suggestions.
> You should evaluate the suggestions and adapt them to your preferred project idea.

You are free to propose your own project idea, as long as it aligns with the project requirements and satisfies the [project evaluation checklist](checklist.md).
When choosing your project, consider your experience, interests, and the level of complexity youâ€™re comfortable with.
Each option offers a unique opportunity to explore cloud technologies and their deployment intricacies.

Each project team will get a responsible member of the teaching staff assigned to them.
This should be the main contact person to reach out to for guidance and support.
The responsible staff member names listed below are only tentative, and will be adjusted to balance the workload among the teaching staff.

### Specific Project Ideas

1. **QuickFeed Continuous Deployment**

   Modernize QuickFeed deployment with containerization and continuous deployment.

   In this project you will prepare container images for deploying the QuickFeed server to a test environment and then the production environment.
   The deployment environment should be configured to support Continuous Deployment.

   The current production version of Quickfeed runs on a virtual machine on one of UiS's Unix machines.
   However, development and testing in this environment result in a certain amount of fragility.
   Hence, we would like to move to a world where setting up and running a test environment is as simple as building and running a container or even simpler.

   **Core Goals (Required):**
   - Containerize the QuickFeed server with optimized Docker images
   - Create Docker Compose setup for local development/testing
   - Support multiple deployment environments for testing and production
   - Deploy to UiS Kubernetes environment
   - Add health checks and basic monitoring

   **Optional Enhancements (If Time Allows):**
   - Deploy to a cloud platform: Unikraft, fly.io, GCP, AWS, Azure
   - Implement rollback capabilities for failed deployments
   - Zero-downtime deployments with Kubernetes
   - Advanced monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

2. **QuickFeed: Running Student Tests with Kubernetes**

   In this project you will prepare a Kubernetes cluster to run student tests.
   This will involve interacting with Kubernetes API to deploy a container to run and test student submitted code.

   In this project we aim to scale QuickFeed to support more courses and users.
   One of the key challenges with QuickFeed is that we currently run tests of student code on every push to GitHub.
   This can cause a significant delay when many students are actively working on their assignments, or we manually trigger a rebuild.
   This is because each student submission is tested in a separate docker container running on the same virtual machine as the QuickFeed server.

   To scale QuickFeed, this project will implement deployment of the containers to a Kubernetes cluster with appropriate scheduling and task management.
   For this project, the Kubernetes cluster can be run locally on our OpenStack cluster machines.

   You may also consider doing this project using a serverless framework from one of the cloud providers.

   **Core Goals (Required):**
   - Set up local UiS Kubernetes cluster for development
