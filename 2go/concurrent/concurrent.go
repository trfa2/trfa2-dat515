// Task: Concurrency with Goroutines for Cloud Applications
//
// This exercise teaches goroutines and channels which are essential for building
// scalable cloud applications. You'll learn to handle concurrent requests,
// parallel processing, and synchronization patterns common in cloud services.

// WorkerResult represents the result of a worker task
type WorkerResult struct {
	ID     int
	Result int
	Error  error
}

// ProcessConcurrently processes a slice of numbers concurrently using goroutines.
// It should spawn a goroutine for each number, double it, and collect results.
// Use channels to communicate results back to the main goroutine.
// The function should return results in the same order as the input.
func ProcessConcurrently(numbers []int) []int {
	// TODO: Implement concurrent processing using goroutines and channels
	return nil
}

// WorkerPool implements a worker pool pattern commonly used in cloud services.
// It should create 'numWorkers' goroutines that process tasks from the 'tasks' channel.
// Each task is an integer that should be doubled.
// Results should be sent to the returned channel as WorkerResult structs.
// The pool should stop when the tasks channel is closed.
func WorkerPool(numWorkers int, tasks <-chan int) <-chan WorkerResult {
	// TODO: Implement worker pool pattern
	return nil
}

// RateLimitedProcessor processes items with a rate limit using channels.
// It should process at most 'rateLimit' items per time period.
// Use a buffered channel as a semaphore to control the rate.
// Each item should be processed by doubling its value.
func RateLimitedProcessor(items []int, rateLimit int) []int {
	// TODO: Implement rate-limited processing
	return nil
}

// FanOutFanIn demonstrates the fan-out/fan-in pattern.
// Fan-out: distribute work across multiple goroutines
// Fan-in: collect results from multiple goroutines into a single channel
// Process the input slice by splitting it across 'numWorkers' goroutines,
// each doubling their assigned numbers, then collect all results.
func FanOutFanIn(numbers []int, numWorkers int) []int {
	// TODO: Implement fan-out/fan-in pattern
	return nil
}

// SafeCounter implements a thread-safe counter using mutex.
// This is important for maintaining state in concurrent cloud applications.
type SafeCounter struct {
	// TODO: Add necessary fields (mutex and counter)
}

// NewSafeCounter creates a new SafeCounter
func NewSafeCounter() *SafeCounter {
	// TODO: Initialize SafeCounter
	return nil
}

// Increment safely increments the counter
func (c *SafeCounter) Increment() {
	// TODO: Implement thread-safe increment
}

// Value safely returns the current counter value
func (c *SafeCounter) Value() int {
	// TODO: Implement thread-safe value retrieval
	return 0
