## Introduction

The goal of this lab assignment is to get you started with RPC-based and REST-based network programming in Go.
The overall aim of the lab project is to implement robust network services that can handle various types of client requests.
Knowledge of network programming in Go is naturally a prerequisite for accomplishing this.

This lab assignment consist of three parts.
In the first part, you will be implementing a web server with various endpoints and features.
In the second part, you will be implementing an in-memory key-value storage using the gRPC framework.
Finally, the last part involves answering networking questions and demonstrating your understanding of network programming concepts.

It is recommended that you actively use the documentation available for this package during your work on this lab assignment.
