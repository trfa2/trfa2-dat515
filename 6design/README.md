## Table of Contents

- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- [1. Design Document (design.md)](#1-design-document-designmd)

The design document is the first deliverable for your project.
We separated this out as a separate deliverable, with its own deadline, to ensure that you have a clear plan before you start coding.
This part only needs a cursory review by the teaching staff to ensure it is sufficiently comprehensive, while still realistic.
The teaching staff will assign you to a project mentor who will provide guidance and support throughout the development process.

## 1. Design Document (design.md)

You are required to prepare a design document for your application.
The design doc should be brief, well-organized and easy to understand.
The design doc should be prepared in markdown format and named `design.md` and submitted in the project group's repository.
Remember that you can use [mermaid diagrams](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid#readme) in markdown files.

The design doc **should include** the following sections:

- **Overview**: A brief description of the application and its purpose.
- **Architecture**: The high-level architecture of the application, including components, interactions, and data flow.
- **Technologies**: The cloud computing technologies or services used in the application.
- **Deployment**: The deployment strategy for the application, including any infrastructure requirements.

The design document should be updated throughout the development process and reflect the final implementation of your project.

Optional sections may include:

- Security: The security measures implemented in the application to protect data and resources.
- Scalability: The scalability considerations for the application, including load balancing and auto-scaling.
- Monitoring: The monitoring and logging strategy for the application to track performance and detect issues.
- Disaster Recovery: The disaster recovery plan for the application to ensure business continuity in case of failures.
- Cost Analysis: The cost analysis of running the application on the cloud, including pricing models and cost-saving strategies.
- References: Any external sources or references used in the design document.
