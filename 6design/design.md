# Design Document

> Keep this document brief (2–4 pages), clear, and up-to-date throughout the project.
> You may use Mermaid diagrams for architecture visuals.

## How to use this template

- Replace all placeholders with your project-specific content.
- Keep explanations concise; link to code or docs when helpful.
- Update this document as the design evolves to match the final implementation.

---

## 1. Overview

Briefly describe the application and its purpose.

- Problem statement: What problem are you solving?
- Target users / personas: Who benefits from this?
- Primary objectives: 3–5 bullet points.
- Non-goals: What is explicitly out of scope?
- Key features: Short bullet list of core functionality.

## 2. Architecture

High-level architecture, main components, interactions, and data flow. Include a system diagram.

### 2.1 System diagram

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  client[Client/UI] --> api[API Gateway / Web Server]
  api --> svc1[Service A]
  api --> svc2[Service B]
  svc1 --> db[(Database)]
  svc2 --> cache[(Cache)]
  svc2 --> ext[(External API)]
```

- Components and responsibilities: What does each box do?
- Data flow: How does data move between components?
- State management: Where is state stored (DB, cache, object store)?
- External dependencies: APIs, third-party services, webhooks.

### 2.2 Data model (if applicable)

- Core entities and relationships (ER sketch or brief description).
- Example records or schemas (link to files or include concise snippets).

### 2.3 APIs (REST/gRPC/GraphQL)

- Interface style and rationale.
- Link to OpenAPI/Proto files, or list a few key endpoints/RPCs.

## 3. Technologies

List the cloud services, libraries, and tools you will use and why.

| Technology / Service | Role / Where Used | Why chosen (brief) | Alternatives considered |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
|                      |                   |                    |                         |

Notes:

- Languages & frameworks (e.g., Go, Node, Python; Gin, Fiber, Echo).
- Cloud provider and managed services (compute, DB, storage, messaging).
- CI/CD, IaC, containerization.

## 4. Deployment

Describe the deployment strategy and infrastructure requirements.

- Environments: dev / staging / prod (if applicable).
- Runtime platform: Docker, Compose, Kubernetes, serverless, PaaS.
- Infrastructure diagram (optional):

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph Cloud
    lb[Load Balancer]
    asg[Service / Deployment]
    db[(Managed DB)]
    bucket[(Object Storage)]
  end
  user((User)) --> lb --> asg --> db
  asg --> bucket
```

- Configuration & secrets: Env vars, secret manager, .env files (never commit secrets).
- Build & release: How artifacts are built; link to CI/CD if used.
- Deployment steps: Summarize here; full, reproducible steps must be in report.md.
- Scaling strategy: Horizontal/vertical scaling, autoscaling triggers.

---

## Optional Sections

Include the sections below as applicable to your project.

### Security

- Authn/Authz model; data protection; TLS/HTTPS; secrets handling; dependency scanning.

### Scalability

- Expected load; performance targets; bottlenecks; caching; rate limits.

### Monitoring & Logging

- Health checks; logs; metrics (e.g., Prometheus); dashboards; alerting.

### Disaster Recovery

- Backups; restore procedures; RPO/RTO targets; failure scenarios.

### Cost Analysis

- Main cost drivers; pricing model; cost-saving measures; budget estimate.

### References

- Links to papers, docs, blog posts, prior art, and any external resources.
